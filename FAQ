FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS


Q. 	Can I play Some Chess against the computer?
A. 	Nope.  That's a whole lot of AI that I don't have time to program.  Some Chess is done
	in my free time, and I don't want to spend all my free time writing chess AI.  With that
	said, if you want to donate money towards me writing an AI we could talk about that— but 
	contact me first if that's what you want.
	
Q.	Can I use Some Chess on my website?
A.	Yes, of course.

Q.	Can I charge people to play?
A.	No.

Q.	Can I charge for anything?
A. 	Yes, you can charge to support and expand Some Chess, but you must keep the license.

Q.	I get a message that says something like this, "Failed opening 'languages/_main.php" 
	What am I doing wrong?
A.	You need to specify the language in the config file. (by default it is "en" so you 
	probably erased it)

Q.	I get a message that says something like this, "A link to the server could not be established" 
	What am I doing wrong?
A.	I can't tell you for sure, but I can say that your connection to the MySQL table isn't 
	happening.  Check to make sure you are using the right information (host, username, password, 
	database name) in the config file
