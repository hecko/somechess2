<h2>Some Info</h2>

<p><h3>Moving</h3> You move in Some Chess by clicking first on the square you want to 
move from and then on the square you'd like to move to.</p>

<p><h3>Castling</h3> The rule when castling is that you always move your king first.  In Some Chess 
you move you king first and the rook will automaticaly go to the proper square.</p>

<p><h3>Pawn Promotion</h3> Once you get your pawn to the other player's back line you will be given the 
choice of what to promote the pawn to.</p>

<p><h3>Stalemate</h3> Right now Some Chess doesn't know what a stalemate is.  The honor system is nice, 
both players should agree to draw (which is what a stalemate is).</p>

<p><h3>Resign</h3> If you want to give up click the "Resign" button.  The game will be end and 
it will be counted as a loss for you.  Be careful because there is no way to undo this.</p>

<p><h3>Draw</h3> You can suggest a draw at anytime by clicking on the "Draw" button.  Your opponent must accept, 
otherwise the game will continue. To reject a draw offer all you have to do is make your next move.</p>

<p><h3>Undo</h3> You can request an undo within thiry seconds of your last move.  Your opponent must accept, otherwise the game
will continue. To reject an undo request all you have to do is make your next move. <i>(Note: this function must be enabled
by an admin)</i></p>

<p><h3>Ending a Game</h3> If a player hasn't made a move in a long time you will get the option to end the game. To end a 
game click on the game in the menu, there will now be a "End" button in the options panel under the chess board. If there are 
two or more complete moves in the game the win will go to the person who moved last, otherwise the game will simply be deleted. 
Be careful because there is no way to undo this. Note, the default for the number of days before the "end" option appears
is twenty, but the admin can set this number higher or lower.</p>

<p><h3>Points</h3> Points are calculated using the standard system, the number of wins plus the number of draws divided by two 
or Wins + (Draws/2) = Points.</p>

<p><h3>Notation</h3> Some Chess uses <a href="http//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Game_Notation" class="about">pgn</a> 
notation, which you can export once the game is complete.  This is a nice way to save & play through 
your games again in another program, etc.</p>

<p><h3>Importing PGN</h3> To view a past game that is not in the database, played on Some Chess or elsewhere, all you need
to do is paste the entire contents of the game into the field under the "Import Game" option.</p>

<p><h3>Adding a User Image</h3> If this option is enabled you can add a custom image to your account. The option is located
in the "Profile" window of the "Menu" page, just click "browse" and locate any image file.  Please note that the image will 
be automatically resized to 85x85 pixels. The following image formats are accepted PNG, GIF, and JPG. <i>(Note: this function must be enabled
by an admin)</i></p>

<p><h3>Gonna Forget Your Password?</h3> In order to reset your password you'll need to put in a security question and answer, otherwise
you'll have to ask an admin to do it manually.</p>

<h2>Some Trouble</h2>
<p>If you find something that Some Chess is doing wrong, or find something that Some Chess should 
be doing, <a href="mailtojon@astrodogpress.com">please let me know</a>.</p>

<p>If Some Chess doesn't look nice to you, you're probably using MS Internet Explorer.  
Stop doing that.  Seriously though, MS Internet Explorer has a lot of bugs  doesn't follow important standards 
which makes it difficult to code for, I'll be making an effort to ensure that Some Chess is usuable in IE, but 
it is a very low priority.  I am sorry, but any other modern browser (ex. firefox, safari, opera, camino)  
works perfectly.</p>

<p>Finally, I just want to say thanks for using this.  Thanks.</p>
