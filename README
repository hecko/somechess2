Some Chess is very easy to install, all you have to do is copy this folder & files 
to your website and edit the config.php file.


Requirements: PHP (tested with PHP 5.4), MySQL

INSTALLATION:
1)  create your Some Chess database, somechess is the default in the config file, but you 
	can change the name to anything you'd like.

2) 	edit the example_config.php file with the proper info and rename the file config.php  
	The file has all the info you should need. Note: you should delete everything that is 
	commented out to make Some Chess run faster.

3) 	copy the Some Chess folder to your server

4) 	load the index page in your browser to auto-install the somechess tables. Alternatively 
	(or if auto-installation fails), you can manually create the tables using the included 
	"MYSQL" file. 
	
	Note: If you want a prefix on the tables AND are manually installing the tables you'll 
	need to add the prefix to the tables yourself by editing the MYSQL file.

5)	it is recommended that you delete these files after installation is complete files: 
		¥ MYSQL
		¥ MYSQL_UPDATE
		¥ install.php

6) 	login with username: admin password: admin (you should change this once you login)

Do not forget to change domain name in MySQL database table `options`! This is important for sending emails!

7) 	invite friends & play chess!


OPTIONAL:

8)	modify the admin options from the defaults as you'd like

9)	to use the backup function with cron enter the following in cron (w/out quotes)
	"php -q /YOUR/HOME/FOLDER/somechess/backup.php"



*If auto installation fails it is probably because of permissions and you will need to create 
the databases and tables manually if you are unfamiliar with this process I recommend going 
to the MySQL website and reading about "SQL Queries."  Or using a program like phpMyAdmin 
(if available).
